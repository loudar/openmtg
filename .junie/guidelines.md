- Always use `bun` instead of `npm` or `node`
- Always use Pixie.js for rendering
- Separate code into either of the two:
  - Classes when it makes sense (one file per class)
  - Exported functions (export function xxx etc.) (multiple functions regarding similar concerns per file)
- Instead of `if (!somevariable) immediatestatement;`, always use braces {} to put the statement in the next line
